"""Shared pytest fixtures.

Neutralise the layout editor's real render path for the whole suite.
``Ti2RelayoutDialog._regenerate`` builds and starts a ``_RegenWorker`` — a
background ``printtarg`` run. On a machine without ArgyllCMS (e.g. a Windows
dev box or CI), that render *fails*, and the worker's ``done`` signal carries an
exception. Because the signal is queued, it is delivered during a *later*
test's event processing (pytest-qt drains the event queue in
``pytest_runtest_setup``), where ``_on_regen_done`` pops a modal
``QMessageBox.warning`` — which blocks the headless suite forever. On macOS with
Argyll installed the render succeeds, so the modal never appears and the leak is
invisible there; this is purely a "passes on Mac, hangs on Windows" hazard.

No test exercises the dialog's real worker (the regenerate logic is covered
directly via ``workflow.ti2_relayout``), and tests that need bespoke behaviour
still override ``_regenerate`` on their own instance. So default it to a no-op
at the class level: no real subprocess, no cross-test signal leak, no modal.
