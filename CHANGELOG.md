# Changelog

## v1.1.3
### Fixed
- Tooltip (ⓘ) and settings (⚙) icons now render crisp on Retina / HiDPI displays instead of appearing blurry.

## v1.1.2
### Improved
- The universal DMG now runs **natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs** (universal2 fat binary). Previously it was arm64 only and required Rosetta on Intel machines.

## v1.1.1
### Improved
- macOS title bar now matches the dark app theme.
- Check & Refine: re-measurement threshold is now user-editable.
- Check & Refine: the resume option is hidden when no matching `.ti3` file exists.
- Tooltip buttons remain clickable even when their parent panel is collapsed.
### Fixed
- Button heights and vertical alignment corrected throughout the UI.

## v1.1.0
### Added
- **Check & Refine tab** — run `profcheck` on a finished profile, see per-patch ΔE results, and selectively re-measure only the worst patches with guided strip-by-strip instructions.
### Improved
- File open dialogs now show only relevant file types and include sidebar shortcuts for quick navigation.

## v1.0.3
### Fixed
- Pink / magenta screen artifact on Apple Silicon during measurement (disabled native file dialogs).
- App now auto-detects ArgyllCMS on launch and shows a clear setup guide if it is not found.
- Wrong-strip dialog now appears when chartread detects a mismatch during measurement.
- Unexpected colour-response warning dialog added (high ΔE on a known patch).

### Added
- Resume measurement flag (`-r`) exposed in measurement options.

## v1.0.2
### Added
- Calibration prompt dialog when chartread asks to position the instrument.
- Navigation instructions popup shown after instrument calibration completes.
- Completion dialog when all stripes have been successfully measured.
- Retry dialog on strip read failure.
### Improved
- Measurement settings are disabled while chartread is running to prevent accidental changes.

## v1.0.1
### Added
- Initial public release as a distributable DMG.
