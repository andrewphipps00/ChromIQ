"""Derive a **dense-grid** chart's patch geometry from its rendered TIFF page(s).

This is the i1Profiler counterpart to :mod:`workflow.layout_from_render`. That
module segments a *printtarg* chart — strips of patches separated by spacers,
described by a ``.ti2``. i1Profiler charts are the opposite shape: a single
**zero-gap grid** filled **column-major**, with no strips, no spacers and no
``.ti2`` we can trust (i1Profiler ignores the per-patch positions a ``.pwxf``
carries and re-lays the grid itself — verified in #120). So this module works
from the two things ChromIQ *does* hold: the rendered chart i1Profiler saved as
a TIFF, and the **ordered patch list** ChromIQ exported to i1Profiler.

## What i1Profiler's layout is (reverse-engineered in #120)

Given ``N`` patches, patch size ``pw × ph`` mm and a page, i1Profiler builds a
single logical grid of ``cols`` columns × ``rows_total`` rows
(``cols = floor(usable_width / pw)``, ``rows_total = ceil(N / cols)``), fills it
**column-major in list order** (``index = col*rows_total + row_global``), and
splits it into pages of a fixed row count, **balanced** across pages (a 50-row
grid over 2 pages is 25 + 25, not 20 + 20 + 10). Patch ``i`` of the exported
list therefore lands at:

    col        = i // rows_total
    row_global = i %  rows_total
    page       = row_global // rows_per_page
    row_on_page= row_global %  rows_per_page

Multi-page charts save as **separate** TIFF files (``…_1_2.tif``), not one
multi-frame file, so *tiff_paths* is the pages in print order.

## How this module recovers it

The grid is not assumed. Each page's patch block is located by masking to the
exported patch colours (i1Profiler renders device values byte-exact — no colour
transform on save), its column/row boundaries are read off the projection of
colour edges (every internal line is a real edge here, because column-major
neighbours are always different colours), and each cell is then **colour-checked
against the patch the fill rule predicts for it**. Any mismatch — a shifted
grid, a wrong column count, the wrong page order — raises
:class:`GridGeometryError` rather than emit a silently misregistered target
(correct-or-absent, the same policy as :mod:`workflow.layout_from_render`).

The result is the same scanner-layout block
``{"engine": "derived", "patches": [{loc, page, x, y, w, h}, …], "dpi": …,
"paper_mm": …}`` that :mod:`workflow.scanin_target` already consumes, so the
``.cht``/``.cie`` build and the whole scanin pipeline work unchanged.
